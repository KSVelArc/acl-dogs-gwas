Detecting Genomic Variants Associated With Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) Rupture In Dogs
===========================================================================================
`Baker, Lauren A. et al. (2018). Genome-wide association analysis in dogs implicates 99 loci as risk variants for anterior cruciate ligament rupture. Dryad. https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.8kk06`

**Summary**\
The ACL is a ligament that connects the thighbone to the shinbone, stabilizing the knee joint. While certain types of physical activity are risk factors for an ACL injury, heritability studies have shown a genetic contribution to increased risk of ligament rupture. ACL rupture is common in humans and dogs. The risk of ACL is higher in femailes and some dog breeds.

**Dataset**\
237 Labrador retrievers phenotyped for ACL rupture: 1 = 139 unaffected, 2 = 98 affected
